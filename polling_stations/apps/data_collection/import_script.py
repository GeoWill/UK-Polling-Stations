    # Automate Import script creation

    ## Workflow

    * CSV uploaded and trigger creates an issue on github.
    * Run a command locally that takes a gss code as an argument e.g. `python manage.py generate_import E07000092`:
        - Get the most recent `report.json` from the data directory
        - if there is no local branch then create one.
        - create a commit which contains an attempt to update the script

    ## ImportScript class

    Class to represent an import script.

    Import scripts have a few distinct sections which determine the sort of data the class should hold.
    * Imports
    * Properties
        - council_id
        - addresses_name
        - stations_name
        - districts_name
        - elections
        - csv_delimiter
    * Methods
        - district_record_to_dict
        - address_record_to_dict
        - station_record_to_dict

    There are also a few things that will be helpful to know about (which are usefully in the report):
    * Report (where the report is to get most of the below)
    * Github issue (to make the commit message)
    * Council Name (to make a command if required)
    * EMS (to expose the right methods and properties)
    * Path (where the script module is - not derived from report)

    TODO
    * Write some tests
    * Imports aren't handled well at the moment
    * Methods aren't handled at all.
        * specifically it would be great to check for uprns that are being used for  setting the 'accept suggestion'
          flag that still appear in the output when the command is run. However that requires a second pass over the
          script with a 'warning.txt' file present. This probably means that the ImportScript class should be able to
          parse such a file.
    * Doesn't handle democracy counts at all.
